- ðŸ”­ Hey there! I'm Hermenegildo Luis, a passionate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) professional with a knack for turning data into actionable insights. With over a decade of experience in the field, I've had the privilege of working on diverse projects that span from aiding humanitarian efforts to supporting government development programs. My journey in GIS has been nothing short of exciting, and I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and push the boundaries of what's possible with spatial data.

####  Education
  
- ðŸŒ± I kicked off my journey at the University Eduardo Mondlane, where I delved into the fascinating world of Geographic Information Science and Cartography. From 2009 to 2013, I immersed myself in courses like spatial analysis, data management, and GIS applications, earning myself a Bachelor's degree. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Geographic Information Science and Systems at the Nova Information Management School, University Nova de Lisboa, further honing my skills and expertise in the field.

#### Courses and training

- ðŸ‘¯ But my learning didn't stop there. Over the years, I've taken several specialized courses and trainings to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in GIS technology. From data analytics to geodatabase management, I've dabbled in it all, gaining valuable insights and practical knowledge along the way.
